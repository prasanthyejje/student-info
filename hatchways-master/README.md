# Hatchways Online Front-end Assessment
## Hatchways Student Roster
By: Vincent Tang

This app allows the user to view a Student Roster containing detailed information about the student, such as their email address, company, skills, and test scores. Search functions by name and by tag are available at the top of the page to filter students by user input terms. Users can add custom tags to individual students for ease of access.

### Starting the app
1) From the command line, ```cd``` into the submission file directory.
2) Install necessary dependencies by running ```npm install``` in the command line.
3) At the root of the submission directory, run the app using ```npm start```.
4) If your browser does not automatically open, please manually open your browser and navigate to ```localhost:3000``` once the command line shows that the project has "compiled successfully".
